## A note on terminology

This document defines every specialised term either at first use or in
[`GLOSSARY.md`](./GLOSSARY.md). Mathematical symbols are introduced
with their units. Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, with the
abbreviation in parentheses, and used as the abbreviation thereafter
within the same section.

## 1. Objective

Validate the stress framework against real historical events. The
pass-or-fail criterion from [`SCENARIOS.md §6.1`](./SCENARIOS.md) is
precise: applied at $t_0$ = one day before the event, the framework
must flag at least one of (notation: $\mathrm{LCR_{oc}}$ denotes the
on-chain Liquidity Coverage Ratio defined in
[`METHODOLOGY.md §2.1`](./METHODOLOGY.md); $\mathrm{TTI}$ denotes
time-to-illiquid; $\sigma_{Sk}$ denotes stress scenario $k$ from
[`SCENARIOS.md §3`](./SCENARIOS.md)):

- *On-chain Liquidity Coverage Ratio*: $\mathrm{LCR_{oc}}(M, t_0, \sigma_{S5}, h = 24\text{h}) < 100\%$;
- *Time-to-illiquid*: $\mathrm{TTI}(M, \sigma_{S1,q_{0.99}}, h = 24\text{h}) < 24$ hours;
- *Bad-debt probability*: $\Pr[\text{bad debt} > 0 \mid \sigma_{S4}] > 5\%$.

If the framework fails this test, we report honestly. There are three
possible explanations:

1. **Calibration error**: the framework is correctly designed but
  miscalibrated. Adjustable in a later version.
2. **Inherent unforeseeability**: the event was not predictable from
  on-chain data alone (for example, an off-chain exploit signal).
  This is the *academically interesting* outcome.
3. **Specification bug**: the framework as specified does not capture
  the relevant risk channel. Requires methodology revision.

We commit to reporting all three cases honestly in the public writeup
(see [`REPORT.md`](./REPORT.md)).

## 2. Events selected for validation

We use three high-impact events with distinct risk profiles, spanning
the 2022 to 2026 window. Each event is packaged as a versioned
*fixture* under `data/fixtures/<event-id>/`, comprising:

- `event.yaml`, event metadata (date, $t_0$, affected markets,
  summary);
- `prices.csv`, collateral price time series (oracle and market) for
  $\pm 5$ days around the event;
- `markets.json`, affected market states at $t_0 - 1$ day (snapshot);
- `positions.csv`, borrower positions on those markets at $t_0 - 1$
  day;
- `dex_slippage.csv`, Uniswap V3 historical swaps for slippage
  calibration;
- `sources.md`, full source attribution per data point.

### 2.1 KelpDAO collateral exploit (April 2026): primary anchor

- **Date**: 20 April 2026, approximately 14:00 UTC.
- **Day-zero ($t_0$)**: 19 April 2026, 23:59 UTC.
- **Description**: The KelpDAO liquid-restaking-token collateral was
  exploited, draining approximately 292 million U.S. dollars from
  Aave; approximately 196 million U.S. dollars materialised as bad
  debt. Morpho Blue isolated lending markets using the same collateral
  (rsETH and ezETH variants) saw cascading liquidations.
- **Why anchor**: most recent, highest-impact, *isolated-market design
  under test*, large MetaMorpho vault flows post-event.

### 2.2 USDC depeg (March 2023): stable-collateral stress

- **Date**: 11 March 2023, approximately 02:00 UTC.
- **Day-zero ($t_0$)**: 10 March 2023, 02:00 UTC.
- **Description**: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Circle, the
  USDC issuer, held approximately 3.3 billion U.S. dollars at Silicon
  Valley Bank, caused USDC to trade briefly at approximately 0.88
  U.S. dollars on secondary markets. The Aave USDC market saw mass
  migration; many DAI-collateralised positions liquidated as DAI fell
  in tandem with USDC, given DAI's significant USDC backing on Maker.
- **Why selected**: stable-on-stable depeg; oracle-versus-market gap
  pattern; predates Morpho Blue. We use this event as a
  *transposition test*: we apply the framework to a *counterfactual*
  Morpho Blue lending market with the same collateral-and-loan-asset
  pair.

### 2.3 Staked-Ether discount (May 2022): liquid-staking-token discount

- **Date**: 12 May 2022, approximately 09:00 UTC.
- **Day-zero ($t_0$)**: 11 May 2022, 09:00 UTC.
- **Description**: Staked-Ether traded at approximately 0.94 of its
  underlying asset, Ether, on Curve following the collapse of Terra
  and its UST stablecoin, combined with concerns over the staked-Ether
  withdrawal queue (pre-Shapella, staked-Ether had no direct
  withdrawal mechanism, the Curve staked-Ether-to-Ether pool was the
  de facto exit liquidity, and it became heavily skewed). Aave
  staked-Ether-to-Ether positions sat near liquidation thresholds;
  manual intervention from the Aave team avoided large liquidation
  cascades.
- **Why selected**: a structural discount on a liquid-staking-token
  versus its underlying asset; a slow-rolling drawdown (not instant);
  predates Morpho Blue, counterfactual application.

## 3. Counterfactual methodology

For events that predate Morpho Blue (USDC, staked-Ether), we cannot
directly observe Morpho Blue lending-market state. Instead, we
*construct counterfactual markets* with parameters reflective of
current Morpho Blue practice:

- The liquidation loan-to-value threshold $\Lambda$ is chosen by
  analogy with similar live markets today (for example, the USDC-USDC0
  Morpho Blue market $\Lambda$ is used for the USDC depeg fixture);
- The interest rate model is the AdaptiveCurveIRM with default
  parameters;
- The position distribution is sampled from a synthetic but realistic
  distribution (50 to 200 positions, log-normal sizes, loan-to-value
  drawn from a Beta distribution centred near 0.7). Recorded aggregates anchor the totals; the individual split is a synthetic reconstruction, a documented limitation of the backtest fixtures (the forward panorama, by contrast, evaluates the actual onchain book since v1.1).

This is **not a true backtest of historical Morpho Blue performance**.
It is a "what-if" stress: had Morpho Blue existed with realistic
parameters at the time of the event, would our framework have flagged
it?

The KelpDAO event predates the framework but post-dates Morpho Blue,
so for that event we use the *observed Morpho Blue lending-market
state* at $t_0 - 1$. This is the strongest validation; the other two
are weaker counterfactuals.

We report all three transparently and weight the conclusions
accordingly.

## 4. Fixture format

### 4.1 `event.yaml`

```yaml
event_id: "kelpdao_2026_04"
event_name: "KelpDAO liquid-restaking-token exploit"
event_ts: "2026-04-20T14:00:00Z"
t0_ts: "2026-04-19T23:59:00Z"
window_pre_days: 5
window_post_days: 5
affected_collaterals: ["rsETH", "ezETH"]
affected_loan_assets: ["WETH", "USDC"]
counterfactual: false # KelpDAO is post-Morpho-Blue
expected_red_flag: true # framework must flag
notes: |
 Event details, post-mortem links, sources.
```

### 4.2 `prices.csv`

| ts | symbol | `price_usd` | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-15T00:00:00Z | rsETH | 3142.50 | chainlink (block 21923500) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Sampled at hourly cadence within the window. Source attribution per
row.

### 4.3 `markets.json`

```json
{
 "market_id": "0x...",
 "loan_asset_symbol": "USDC",
 "collateral_asset_symbol": "rsETH",
 "lltv": 0.86,
 "snapshot_block": 21924000,
 "snapshot_ts": "2026-04-19T23:59:00Z",
 "total_supply_assets": 45000000,
 "total_borrow_assets": 38000000,
 "total_collateral": 12500.0,
 "oracle_price_at_snapshot": 3050.0,
 "rate_at_target_at_snapshot": 0.045
}
```

The `lltv` field denotes the liquidation loan-to-value threshold,
abbreviated `LLTV` in the on-chain Solidity code by Morpho Labs and
preserved here for compatibility.

### 4.4 `dex_slippage.csv`

Historical Uniswap V3 swaps for the affected collateral. Used to
calibrate the slippage curve $\pi(C, V)$ at the time of the event
(not today's liquidity).

| `swap_ts` | `collateral_symbol` | `volume_native` | `volume_usd` | `oracle_price` | `realized_price` | `slippage_bps` | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | `uniswap_v3:0xabc...` |

Slippage in `slippage_bps` is in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%).

## 5. Validation criteria: pass-or-fail rules

For each event, the framework runs and produces a verdict.

```python
@dataclass
class BacktestVerdict:
 event_id: str
 affected_markets: list[str]
 framework_flagged: bool # True if any criterion was triggered
 triggered_criteria: list[str] # which of the 3 §6.1 criteria fired
 metrics: dict[str, float] # values of LCR, TTI, P[bad_debt > 0]
 pass_fail: str # "PASS" if framework_flagged matches expected_red_flag
```

**Aggregate success metric**: at least 2 of 3 events must pass. The
KelpDAO event must pass absolutely (it is the primary anchor).

**Severity flags** (from [`SCENARIOS.md §7`](./SCENARIOS.md)):

- **Red**: at least one criterion is triggered with margin
  ($\mathrm{LCR_{oc}} < 80\%$, time-to-illiquid $< 12$
  hours, or $\Pr[\text{bad debt} > 0] > 20\%$);
- **Yellow**: criterion is triggered weakly
  ($\mathrm{LCR_{oc}} \in [80\%, 100\%)$, time-to-illiquid
  $\in [12\text{h}, 24\text{h})$, or $\Pr[\text{bad debt} > 0] \in [5\%, 20\%)$);
- **Green**: no criterion is triggered.

## 6. Limitations of this backtest

1. **Counterfactual weakness**: the USDC and staked-Ether events
  predate Morpho Blue. The results are indicative, not historically
  accurate.
2. **Position distribution is synthetic** for counterfactual events.
  Real borrower behaviour (concentration, use skew) is hard to
  reconstruct.
3. **Slippage curves are calibrated on time-of-event Uniswap data**.
  Liquidity conditions evolved post-event; we use what would have
  been observable to a liquidator at $t_0$.
4. **No maximal-extractable-value or liquidator-competition
  modelling**. Bias: bad debt is underestimated.
5. **Three events is a small sample**. We report results, not
  statistical significance. A future extension would extend to 10 or
  more events.
