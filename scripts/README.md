# Data acquisition pipeline

These scripts populate `data/cache/*.parquet` from on-chain and off-chain
sources. They form the Phase 2 deliverable described in
[`docs/DATA.md`](../docs/DATA.md).

## Pre-requisites

1. Python environment with the project installed: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
2. A `config.local.yaml` at the project root with:
   - `network.rpc_url` (Alchemy or other Ethereum mainnet endpoint)
   - `subgraph.url` and `subgraph.api_key` (for events and market discovery)
   - `morpho_blue.contract` (default mainnet address, do not change unless
     pointing to a fork)
   - `range.start_ts` and `range.end_ts` (UTC timestamps)
   - `sampling.*` cadences (default values are sensible)
   - `markets:` (list of market ids; fill by running
     `scripts/select_markets.py` first)

3. Free-tier API accounts:
   - Alchemy (or any other Ethereum RPC provider)
   - The Graph (for the Morpho Blue subgraph)
   - DeFiLlama (no auth required)

## Pipeline order (dependencies)

```

       fetch_markets.py      (RPC; needs config.markets populated)

                          (DeFiLlama, independent)
```

## Step-by-step usage

```bash
# Activate venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # Windows (PowerShell)

# 1. Discover top-N markets and patch config.local.yaml
python scripts/select_markets.py --top 10 --in-place

# 2. Fetch market metadata (RPC). ~1-5 min for 10 markets.
python scripts/fetch_markets.py

# 3. Fetch TVL (DeFiLlama). ~10 sec, no dependencies.
python scripts/fetch_tvl.py

# 4. Fetch market state time series (RPC). 5-30 min depending on cadence
#    and number of markets.
python scripts/fetch_market_state.py

# 5. Fetch oracle prices (RPC). 2-10 min.
python scripts/fetch_oracle_prices.py

# 6. Fetch events from subgraph. 1-5 min.
python scripts/fetch_events.py

# 7. Quote slippage curve via Uniswap V3 Quoter (RPC). 1-2 min.
python scripts/fetch_uniswap_quotes.py
```

## Idempotence

Each script is idempotent: re-running with the same configuration
produces the same output (modulo the most recent block, which advances
between runs). Output files are versioned in `data/manifest.json` with
SHA-256 checksums for reproducibility.

## Rate limits

The pipeline is calibrated to free-tier rate limits:

- **Alchemy free**: ~100 requests/second sustained, 300M compute units/month.
  Our pipeline uses < 0.5% of monthly quota for a full run on 10 markets.
- **The Graph free**: 100K queries/month. Our pipeline uses < 1%.
- **DeFiLlama**: no documented rate limit; our usage is one request total.

If you hit rate limits, increase the `wait_exponential` parameters in
`tenacity` decorators within `src/morpho_stress/data/{rpc,subgraph}.py`.

## Validation after fetch

```bash
# Inspect what was written
python -c "
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('data/catalog.duckdb', read_only=True)
print(con.execute('DESCRIBE markets').df())
print(con.execute('SELECT loan_asset_symbol, collateral_asset_symbol, lltv FROM markets').df())
"

# Run all tests, including the data-layer tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/data/ -v
```

If any Parquet write fails the schema check, the script exits non-zero
and writes nothing. Type drift will not silently corrupt the cache.
