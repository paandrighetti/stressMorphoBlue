"""RPC helpers shared across data acquisition scripts.

Provides three operations that several scripts need:

1. `get_erc20_metadata(rpc, address)`: fetch (symbol, decimals) for any ERC-20.
2. `get_block_timestamp(rpc, block_number)`: fetch the wall-clock time of a block.
3. `detect_oracle_type(rpc, oracle_address)`: categorise the oracle source by
   inspecting its interface. Returns one of {chainlink, pyth, redstone,
   uniswap_twap, composite, unknown}.

All three are network-light (single RPC call each), use checksum addresses,
and tolerate partial failures (return sensible defaults rather than raise).
