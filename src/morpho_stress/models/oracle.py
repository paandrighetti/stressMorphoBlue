"""Oracle price models, exogenous and Uniswap-V3-style geometric TWAP.

Two regimes from `docs/SCENARIOS.md §2.3`:

- **Exogenous**: oracle price is an externally-supplied path. Liquidator
  selling does not affect the oracle. Default for off-chain feeds (Chainlink,
  Pyth) where price aggregation happens off-chain.

- **Endogenous (Uniswap V3 TWAP)**: oracle price is the geometric mean of
  observed market prices over a window of ``lambda`` blocks. Implemented
  faithful to Uniswap V3:

      price = 1.0001 ** (cumulative_tick_delta / time_delta)

  where ``tick = log_{1.0001}(price)`` and the cumulative tick is summed
  across observations. This is the geometric mean in the price domain.

class TwapOracle:
    """Uniswap V3-style geometric TWAP over a window of ``lambda`` blocks.

    Implementation:

    1. Each ``update(price, block)`` records a ``(block, tick)`` observation,
       where ``tick = log_{1.0001}(price)``.
    2. ``read()`` returns the geometric mean of prices across the observation
       window:

           tick_avg = (sum_i tick_i × dt_i) / total_dt
           price_twap = 1.0001 ** tick_avg

       where ``dt_i`` is the time interval each tick was active. This matches
       Uniswap V3's ``observeSingle`` semantics: cumulative tick is the
       integral of tick over time, so the average is the time-weighted mean
       in tick (equivalently log-price) space.

    For simplicity, we assume observations come at every block (constant
    ``dt = 1``) when used in the simulation pipeline. The implementation
    accepts non-constant ``dt`` for general use.

    The geometric mean is the right average for prices because compounded
    returns are additive in log-space, this is also why Uniswap V3 chose it.
