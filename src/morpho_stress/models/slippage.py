"""DEX slippage model, π(C, V).

Slippage is the relative shortfall between the oracle-quoted price and the
realized DEX execution price for selling `V` units of collateral `C`:

    π(C, V) = (P_oracle - P_realized) / P_oracle ∈ [0, 1)

We fit a power law per asset:

    π(V) = a · V^b

calibrated on DEX execution data (1inch quotes for forward, Uniswap historical
swaps for backward). The fit is in log-space (log π = log a + b · log V), which
linearizes the regression and gives well-conditioned parameter estimates.

For v0 (mock data), we expose a `SlippageCurve` that can be:
    - constructed from synthetic (a, b) parameters (testing / mock scenarios)
    - fitted from a `dex_slippage` Pandera-validated DataFrame (Phase 4)

      power-law impact has its origins in the equity microstructure literature.
